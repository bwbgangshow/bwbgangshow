        </h3><br><br>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">After a break of nearly 7 years, Billericay, Wickford and Basildon Gang Show came back with a bang! Putting on a show in just one weekend, calling it IGNITE. 
        </p><br>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">The weekend started on Saturday morning with nearly 40 Guides and Scouts, supported by 40 leaders meeting for the first time. Once everyone was registered, they were split up into two groups, the cast, and backstage crew. There was a lot to be done before the show on Sunday afternoon.

        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">The cast moved into a separate hall to start rehearsals. As well as the full cast numbers there were opportunities for the young people to be soloists, dance and be in sketches, and during the day they learnt songs, dance moves and their lines for the sketches. On Sunday morning there was a bit more rehearsal before everyone came together for a quick run through.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">While this was going on the production crew had to get the auditorium ready for the performance. While most people were tasked with painting and preparing the scenery, two small groups got to learnt about lighting and sound. For the lighting team this involved putting the lights up and connecting them to the lighting desk. Once this was done, they were able to set up the lights remotely, and then two of them learnt how to use the follow spotlights. It parallel to this the sound system was set-up. This involved placing microphones on and around the stage, then connecting them to the sound desk and finally the speaker. These than need to be tune for the hall.

        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">Finally, it was time for the performance. This is when everyone came together. The cast took to the stage and the young crew members operated lights, sound, made sure the props where in the right place at the right time. All supported by the regular backstage crew. 
        </p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">None of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the adult helpers, who gave up days and weekends in advance of this event to make it possible. However, the final words should go to our participants and what they thought of the weekendâ€¦.
