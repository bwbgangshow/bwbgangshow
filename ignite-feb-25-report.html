        </h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> After a break of nearly 7 years, Billericay, Wickford and Basildon Gang Show came back with a bang! Putting on a show in just one weekend, calling it IGNITE. 
        </p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> The weekend started on Saturday morning with nearly 40 Guides and Scouts, supported by 40 leaders meeting for the first time. Once everyone was registered, they were split up into two groups, the cast, and backstage crew. There was a lot to be done before the show on Sunday afternoon.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2">The cast moved into a separate hall to start rehearsals. As well as the full cast numbers there were opportunities for the young people to be soloists, dance and be in sketches, and during the day they learnt songs, dance moves and their lines for the sketches. On Sunday morning there was a bit more rehearsal before everyone came together for a quick run through.
        </p>
        <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3">BWB Gang Show<br>
        </h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> BWB Gang Show comprises of Scouting and Guiding members from 3 areas: Billericay, Wickford and Basildon. Our first ever show was held in 1985 which continued to run bi-annually until 2002 when a new producer introduced our first Show In A Day. BWB continued to hold their main Gang Show bi-annually, with Show In A Day being held on the years in between until Covid-19 halted the production. Following the pandemic, 2025 will see the return of BWB Gang Show with the IGNITE two day production.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Cast Numbers</span>
          <br>Cast numbers vary between 50 and 70 in the Senior Gang (Scouts, Guides &amp; Adults) as well as 20 to 30 Cubs &amp; Brownies in the Mini Gang. Show In A Day numbers vary between 60 and 100. We encourage members of all ages from the youngest to the oldest scout and guide members, managing to achieve a friendly ‘family’ feel within the varied age groups.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Rehearsals</span>
          <br>Full shows are quite a commitment but are very rewarding for those that put in the effort. Rehearsals span 5 months leading up to the show, stopping for two weeks over the Christmas and New year period. BWB rehearse every Sunday afternoon from 2.00pm to 5.00pm, although cast are often staggered throughout this time to accommodate different categories of people rehearsing different show items. For those who pass dance team auditions, additional dance rehearsals take place on Sunday mornings between 10.00am and 1.00 pm. For Show in a Day productions, learning and rehearsals are done on the day of the show, with just one performance in the evening. in 2025 the IGNITE show will be held over a weekend, with a single performance on Sunday afternoon.<br>
