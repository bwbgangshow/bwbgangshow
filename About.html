        </h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> 2007 was a significant year for Gang Shows. It marked 100 years of Scouting, the 150th birthday of Baden Powell and 75 years of Gang Show!<br>
          <br>The first ‘Gang’ took a bow in 1932, somewhere in the world there is a Gang Show being produced every day of the year. Its creator, Ralph Reader was for many years, a leading actor and producer in New York and London. He was also a member of the Holdorn Rover Scouts so when he was asked by Scout Headquarters to help raise money for a new campsite swimming pool, a show was the only way to go. During rehearsals it was realised that the title of the show must be decided. After refreshments one evening, Ralph asked one lad if everyone was back ready to start again, and was told “Aye Skip - the Gang’s all here!”. The title had been found and the name stuck! Year after year the Gang Shows were sell-out successes. Ralph started to write his own songs and sketches, many of which are still used today - most famously “We’re riding along on the crest of a wave...” which became the Gang Show anthem and has been sung in every country of the world where Scouting exists. And seventy-five years on, cast members everywhere still proudly wear the red Gang Show scarf, worn only by those who have taken part in one of Ralph’s shows.

        <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3">BWB Gang Show<br>
        </h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> BWB Gang Show comprises of Scouting and Guiding members from 3 areas: Billericay, Wickford and Basildon. Our first ever show was held in 1985 which continued to run bi-annually until 2002 when a new producer introduced our first Show In A Day. BWB continued to hold their main Gang Show bi-annually, with Show In A Day being held on the years in between until Covid-19 halted the production. Following the pandemic, 2025 will see the return of BWB Gang Show with the IGNITE two day production.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Cast Numbers</span>
          <br>Cast numbers vary between 50 and 70 in the Senior Gang (Scouts, Guides &amp; Adults) as well as 20 to 30 Cubs &amp; Brownies in the Mini Gang. Show In A Day numbers vary between 60 and 100. We encourage members of all ages from the youngest to the oldest scout and guide members, managing to achieve a friendly ‘family’ feel within the varied age groups.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Rehearsals</span>
          <br>Full shows are quite a commitment but are very rewarding for those that put in the effort. Rehearsals span 5 months leading up to the show, stopping for two weeks over the Christmas and New year period. BWB rehearse every Sunday afternoon from 2.00pm to 5.00pm, although cast are often staggered throughout this time to accommodate different categories of people rehearsing different show items. For those who pass dance team auditions, additional dance rehearsals take place on Sunday mornings between 10.00am and 1.00 pm. For Show in a Day productions, learning and rehearsals are done on the day of the show, with just one performance in the evening. in 2025 the IGNITE show will be held over a weekend, with a single performance on Sunday afternoon.<br>
